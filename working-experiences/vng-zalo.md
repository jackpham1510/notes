# ELCA


I participated in this internship in the second summer of college, which lasted 3 months.

During this internship, I learned about fundamental knowledges, Java, Spring Framework, Angular, and had to do an exercise to create a tool to manage the progress of projects with the knowledge I learned and then gave presentations to the trainer.

I was the youngest in that internship

# ZaloPay

This is a fresher program organized by VNG company

I work 3 months part-time and 6 months almost full-time

During that time, I learned about Golang, Linux, Nginx, basic knowledge about Microservices and Docker

I was assigned to develop ZaloPay integrated documentation page for 3rd parties, and also provide technical support to 3rd parties if required.

In the project, I have to modify the user interface according to the design and ensure the user interface will be responsive on different screen sizes. 

In addition, I have to write sample code for integration methods in different programming languages and create some demo applications using HTML / CSS / JS and Golang.

You can access that document at docs.zalopay.vn

The document page was developed based on a static site generator called Slate
