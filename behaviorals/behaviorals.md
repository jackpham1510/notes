# What are your weeknesses?

**Perfectionism**

- Sometimes, during the development of some features that are no longer as meaningful as their original names, I tend to want to rename them even if it could affect the compatibility.

**Unfocused**

- Sometimes while I search for a solution to a problem I get wandered into something else that doesn't really help me solve the current problem.

**Carelessness**

- Sometimes, I don't have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always have someone else double check my work

# What questions should you ask the interviewer?

- When I joined the company, was I able to choose a team or was I already assigned a team?

- Can you tell me about the training schedule for new employees?
  - How long it lasts?
  - Who is the trainer?

- Can you describe for me a normal working day of a backend developer at LINE?
